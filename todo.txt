Bugs:
- Suspect: object recycling in ShapeHandler appears to sometimes activate invalid objects.
- Documentation: C# and C++ docuemntation namepaces clash in doxygen.

TODO for v1.0:
- Consolidate C# shape constructors and improve consistency.
- PROTOCOL CHANGE: Reduce object overhead. Creating many objects is expensive in data throughput and packet processing.
  - Modify ObjectAttributes structure (for update messages only?) to have a 1-byte flag member which identifies which of colour, position, rotation and scale data are present.
  - Consider moving major/minor version members of PacketHeader into ServerSettings message.
  - Support batch object creation?
- "Server" implementation which writes directly to a local file.

TODO:
- Change shape shaders to support GPU instancing.
- UI:
  - Handler options and UI
  - Scene Graph UI
- Export to PLY file (because PLY is easy).
- Annotation frames.
  - Skip/step by annotation frames.
- Flush transient objects from a specific category.
  - To support variable update rates. E.g., physics may run at a different frame rate to AI.
- Client rendering override modes:
  - Solid/wireframe overlay
  - Wireframe override
- Tidy up client StreamThread and Router update loops.

Maybe:
- Convert geometry shaders to use vertex shader with vertex padding in the stream.
- Support splitting recording files at around 2GB.
- Consider supporting variable Endian encoding in messages, identified by the byte order of the header marker.
- Consider adding batched object creation messages.

Performance improvements:
- Need to investigate how to do more object management off the main thread. Not well supported by Unity as it doesn't allow objects to be created on other threads.

Pie in the sky:
- Load in a mesh/scene for reference and/or context.
- Python core/server implementation
- Client "breakpoints". Server blocks until the client allows continuation.
  - Difficulty is in nicely specifying the breakpoint and enabling/disabling.
    - Maybe server macros can leverage __FILE__ and __LINE__ to help.
