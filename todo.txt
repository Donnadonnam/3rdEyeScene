Bugs:
- MESHSET_END() macro does not cater for releasing associated resources. Parameterisation needs to change.
  - Consider adding a dummy mesh resource which only exposes an ID, but no data.
- Router UpdateCatchUp is currently incompatible with snapshots. Transient objects will be excluded from the snapshot.
- Large data frames have been known to end up an odd state whereby some data from the previous are still visible and not all data from the next frame are visible.
  - Possibly a thread safety issue on the concurrent queue.
- Custom socket bugs (workaround using Qt sockets):
  - On OSX there is sporadic lag.
  - Large packets go missing.


TODO:
- Profile StreamThread packet decoding and improve performance.
  - Current playback speed bottleneck when stepping.
- Complete C++ TCP socket support built on POCO
- "Server" implementation which writes directly to a local file.
- Change shape shaders to support GPU instancing.
- Consider adding batched object creation messages.
- Consolidate C# shape constructors and improve consistency.
- Client log for error messages.
- UI:
  - Handler options and UI
  - Camera Selection UI
  - Scene Graph UI
- Make sure modal dialogs work properly blocking input to background layers.
- Export to PLY file (because PLY is easy).
- Annotation frames.
  - Skip/step by annotation frames.
- Flush transient objects from a specific category.
  - To support variable update rates. E.g., physics may run at a different frame rate to AI.
- Client rendering override modes:
  - Solid/wireframe overlay
  - Wireframe override
- PROTOCOL CHANGE: Reduce object overhead. Creating many objects is expensive in data throughput and packet processing.
  - Modify ObjectAttributes structure (for update messages only?) to have a 1-byte flag member which identifies which of colour, position, rotation and scale data are present.
  - Consider moving major/minor version members of PacketHeader into ServerSettings message.
  - Support batch object creation?
- Tidy up and fix up Router catcup logic and _currentFrame management.

Maybe:
- GL-TF scene serialiser for the client.
  - For loading reference model and exporting the current scene.
- GL-TF handler extension
  - Too expensive for primitives, but may be good for complex data.
- Support splitting recording files at around 2GB.
- TCP socket support built on asio.
- Consider supporting variable Endian encoding in messages, identified by the byte order of the header marker.

Performance improvements:
- Need to investigate how to do more object management off the main thread. Not well supported by Unity as it doesn't allow objects to be created on other threads.
- Improve shutdown time after using large numbers of objects.

Pie in the sky:
- Load in a mesh/scene for reference and/or context.
- Python core/server implementation
- Client "breakpoints". Server blocks until the client allows continuation.
  - Difficulty is in nicely specifying the breakpoint and enabling/disabling.
    - Maybe server macros can leverage __FILE__ and __LINE__ to help.
- An actual UX design.
